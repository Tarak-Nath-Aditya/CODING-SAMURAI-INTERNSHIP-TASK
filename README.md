# CODING-SAMURAI-INTERNSHIP-TASK 
PROJECT TITLE- PREDICTING FLOWER SPECIES 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION- A simple machine learning model to Predict the species of flowers based on their features.

DATA COLLECTION- For the project,  the iris dataset is collected from the machine learning library seaborn.
DATA PREPROCESSING- Preprocessed the data by handling missing values  encoding .The categorical target variable (species), and splitting the dataset into a training set and a testing set. 

MODEL SELECTION- A simple machine learning algorithm Logistic Regression is used. Also,  Decision Tree Classifier is used as an alternative. 

MODEL TRAINING - Train the selected model using the training dataset. This involved feeding the model with input features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and the corresponding target labels (flower species). 

MODEL EVALUATION- Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using the testing dataset. Common evaluation metrics for classification tasks included accuracy, precision.
PREDICTION- Used the trained model to make predictions on new data points (flower measurements). A basic web application is used where users can input the measurements, and the model predicts the flower species. 
VISUALIZATION-  To Create visualizations such as scatter plots,  bar charts to help others understand how well the model is performing.
